The program starts by asking for an equation, and waiting for a carriage return. Once this happens it tokenizes each character of the equation. Then it steps through each token it has and evaluates it to see if its a number or character. If its a number and looks to see if the next char is a parenthesis, if it is, it solves the expression. If it is a parenthesis it jumps and solves the expression inside the parenthesis before it returns to solving the original expressions.
