The program starts, in main(), by asking for an equation and waiting for a carriage return. Once this happens it tokenizes the first character of the equation and checks to see if it is either an = or a Q to know if it should solve, or quit. Then it continues and steps through each of the following tokens in the equation and evaluates it to see if its a number or character. If its a number and looks to see if the next char is a parenthesis, if it is, it solves the expression. If it is a parenthesis it jumps and solves the expression inside the parenthesis before it returns to solving the original expressions.
